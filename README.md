## **Background:**

The global beauty and skincare industry is characterized by high transaction volumes and aggressive promotional cycles. Operating across diverse international markets, this e-commerce platform manages thousands of SKUs in categories like Makeup and Body Care. While top-line sales figures appear strong, the business faces significant challenges in maintaining healthy profit margins due to varying regional costs and complex discount structures. This project analyzes four years of transactional data to transition the company from a "growth-at-all-costs" model to a "profitable growth" strategy.

## **Problem Statement**

To increase the overall Net Profit Margin by 15% within the next fiscal year by identifying and mitigating profit leakage caused by over-discounting, optimizing underperforming regional markets, and re-allocating marketing resources toward high-value customer segments, validated through statistical testing of 2020-2023 historical data

## **Research Questions**

1. How do monthly and yearly sales trends compare to net profit, and is the business maintaining profitability during high-volume peak seasons?
2. How does the profit ratio vary across different global regions, and are there territories where high sales volume fails to generate positive net income?
3. How many SKUs are required to reach the 80% revenue threshold, and to what extent does the business rely on a small group of "Hero" products?
4. What is the statistical relationship between discount levels, sales quantity, and profit, and does increasing discounts effectively drive proportional volume growth?
5. At what specific discount percentage does a transaction typically transition from being profitable to incurring a net financial loss?
6. Which specific markets are responsible for the highest cumulative net losses, and what is the scale of this capital erosion?
7. Which product categories act as the primary profit engines for the business, and which segments are currently operating with unsustainable or negative margins?
8. Are the differences in profit performance across various global markets statistically significant, or could they be attributed to random operational variance?
9. Can we mathematically quantify the expected impact on profit for every percentage increase in discount to establish data-driven pricing guardrails?
10. How does the profitability and average discount rate of high-volume bulk buyers ("Whales") compare to the general retail market?
